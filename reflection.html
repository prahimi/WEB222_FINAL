    <p>  Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? <br> <br>
        Responsive design is a strict belief that any design wether it be a webpage or program <br>
        should always adjust itself to the behavior of its user and/or environment. Some examples of this would <br>
        be screen size, different web browsers, multiple platform support and so on. <br> <br>
         How does responsive design relate to web technologies? <br> <br>
         Responsive design is extremly important to web technologies. Some applications come preformatted <br>
         for whatever software they are going to be run on. Unfortunately for us, most web applications and sites  <br>
         do not follow the same. They are directly related since web design is very tedious, even the smallest of pixels <br>
         matter. You could create a design that works flawlessly on windows but then open it up on your phone  <br>
         and you realize its unreadable. We must always think ahead before the design to ensure the product will   <br>
         be able to run and display properly on all content pages.  <br> <br>
         What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? <br> <br>
         I learned that we need to constantly adapt to different screen sizes and platforms. Sizes of screens can vary <br>
         from 800+ (desktops) to even 70ish (small phones). It is much easier to build web apps for desktops since we <br>
         generally code on a desktop. Once its time to take it over to a smaller device we may encounter problems <br>
         since it has not been built to support it. <br><br>
         Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.<br><br>
         This was probably one of my favourite courses. I seem to have a better understanding of Javascript compared to C++ <br>
         and enjoy coding in this environment much much more. Before we began this course I thought Web dev was just html, <br>
         I believed it to be tedious, dull and boring. After this course I learned that althought it is tedious <br>
         there is much more. You can use javascript in your html webpage to create applications. If you really want to make your <br>
         site stand out you can inject it with css and transform an ugly webpage into something spectacular.  <br>
         Thank you for everything!
